# YEN Changelog
Product updates, powered by our amazing community!

The goal with our `changelog` is to capture all of the work that we've done to build YEN, starting from the very beginning. This way we have not only a record of our collective accomplishments so we can celebrate our progress but also to increase the level of transparency into the process as we build.

In this way, our `changelog` is a bit different than more traditional ones because we're going to attempt to be a bit more specific with our notes (and definitely better than just a notice that reads: "*We constantly improve our application to provide better service to our users.*"...

We hope that you'll see many of the changes, improvements, bug fixes, and feature updates that you'll see are the **very ones** that **YOU** suggested! We love [co-building with our community](https://github.com/yenio/changelog/wiki/3.-Our-CoBuilders) as it's just a better way of building.

Thank you!



## What is Your Software Development Lifecycle?

Okay, so, that's a mouthful, for sure! But, from here on out you might start learning a thing or two about the process of designing and developing great software! The `SLDC` (or also called the "Software Development Process") can look different based on the team and organization.

But what it is, essentially, is a framework of how ideas and concepts eventually become real software; it defines the tasks needed and the steps required to create working software. This often means developing a plan on how to develop, maintain, replace (or fix) the software. The **goal** is to not only produce something of value but also to help make the process, itself, better over time!

Our team specifically follows a plan that is broken down into 2 Week "Sprints" where we define the tasks we want to accomplish over those two weeks and also blocks out time to review the process itself.

Here's what this looks day-to-day:

### Week 1 (of 2)
- **Mon:** Day #3 of Sprint Cycle ("SC")
- **Tue:** Day #4 of SC
- **Wed:** Day #5 of SC
- **Thurs:** Day #6 of SC
- **Fri:** Day #7 of SC

### Week 2 (of 2)
- **Mon:** Day #8 of SC // Sprint Planning (Plan goals for next sprint, assign tasks)
- **Tue:** Day #9 of SC // Business Requirements (Decide technical solutions matching business logic with engineering requirements) // Code Freeze â€“ "`Cinderella Deploy`" (changes allowed up until midnight PST)
- **Wed:** Day #10 of SC // Deploy to Development / Staging Branches
- **Thurs:** Day #1 of New SC // Master Deploy from Staging to Live // Sprint Retrospective // Goals for Next Sprint
- **Fri:** Day #2 of New SC

You'll notice that we start a new Sprint Cycle on the 2nd Thursday of the 2nd week. 

We plan on adding more context and material around our technical workflows over time but we hope you have learned a thing (or two) and find this type of thing not only interesting but perhaps even useful for your own projects (and those projects don't have to necessarily technical in nature)!

Without further ado... here's what our Sprints have looked like historically and the larger tasks that we attempted to work through!


***





## Sprint 19 (Jan 14 - 25, 2018)

This Sprint is back to our normal 2-week cycle. More details to come.



## Sprint 18 (Dec 21 - Jan 11, 2018)

This Sprint is specifically 3-weeks long instead of the typical 2, given the holidays!


Goals for Sprint 18 are as follows:

Sprint 17 (and 18 and 19 most likely) are still heavily focused on getting our new integrations out and launched and so the next 2-3 sprint cycles will focus almost exclusively on those core elements.

This means that much of Sprint 17/18/19 will be a continuation of Sprint 16 in scope.

- Create and Display Text (with or without URL post)
- Design a 3-column feed where the middle (2nd) column is dynamic (updating) with text and/or URL post 
- Coinbase oAuth Test

### Initial Concepts

- [Concept 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/www9zykc22ymu6d/concept-1.JPG?dl=0)
- [Concept 2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bm0v034xi8cj110/concept-2.jpg?dl=0)
- [Concept 3](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wt7h2tck9vh9o1g/concept-3.jpg?dl=0)
- [Concept 4](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4zktb3nmioiwpk9/concept-4.jpg?dl=0)
- [Schema](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gaap2lpovv7s30p/yen-schema-draft.jpeg?dl=0)

### Authorization & Registration

Authorization/registration screen should look like [this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5mgd40h0wc2picb/0-0-0_register.png?dl=0):

For MVP: Registration only via email (in the future we may have google, fb, twitter, bitcoin pub accounts)

### Create and Display Text

- User can add new post ([screenshot](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9qtulwn9fznwl4w/2-post-two.png?dl=0))
- Upload up to 4 images (via drag-drog or upload)

### 3-Column Design

- 3 colums where the 2nd column is dynamic with posts. All other columns will be empty.
- LoFi [concept](https://www.dropbox.com/s/l3naboqz83hwimz/1-0-0_feed.png?dl=0).

### Coinbase oAuth Test

- US-Only: User needs to be able to connect to Coinbase via oAuth (YEN makes backend call to Coinbase API on behalf of user).I
- [Success](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zjcjwcx5jhwpa9s/success.png?dl=0)!
